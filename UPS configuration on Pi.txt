# UPS configuration | path --> sudo nano /etc/nut/ups.conf
# Network UPS Tools: example ups.conf
#
# --- SECURITY NOTE ---
#
# If you use snmp-ups and set a community string in here, you
# will have to secure this file to keep other users from obtaining
# that string.  It needs to be readable by upsdrvctl and any drivers,
# and by upsd.
#
# ---
#
# This is where you configure all the UPSes that this system will be
# monitoring directly.  These are usually attached to serial ports, but
# USB devices and SNMP devices are also supported.
#
# This file is used by upsdrvctl to start and stop your driver(s), and
# is also used by upsd to determine which drivers to monitor.  The
# drivers themselves also read this file for configuration directives.
#
# The general form is:
#
# [upsname]
#       driver = <drivername>
#         port = <portname>
#       < any other directives here >
#
# The section header ([upsname]) can be just about anything as long as
# it is a single word inside brackets.  upsd uses this to uniquely
# identify a UPS on this system.
#
# If you have a UPS called snoopy, your section header would be "[snoopy]".
# On a system called "doghouse", the line in your upsmon.conf to monitor
# it would look something like this:
#
#       MONITOR snoopy@doghouse 1 upsmonuser mypassword master
#
# It might look like this if monitoring in slave mode:
#
#       MONITOR snoopy@doghouse 1 upsmonuser mypassword slave
#
# Configuration directives
# ------------------------
#
# These directives are used by upsdrvctl only and should be specified outside
# of a driver definition:
#
#    maxretry: Optional.  Specify the number of attempts to start the driver(s),
#              in case of failure, before giving up. A delay of 'retrydelay' is
#              inserted between each attempt. Caution should be taken when using
#              this option, since it can impact the time taken by your system to
#              start.
#
#              The default is 1 attempt.
#
#  retrydelay: Optional.  Specify the delay between each restart attempt of the
#              driver(s), as specified by 'maxretry'. Caution should be taken
#              when using this option, since it can impact the time taken by your
#              system to start.
#
#              The default is 5 seconds.
#
# These directives are common to all drivers that support ups.conf:
#
#  driver: REQUIRED.  Specify the program to run to talk to this UPS.
